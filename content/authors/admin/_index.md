<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Biology at NTNU since August 2019. My work involves the building and analysis of logical models of various biological systems, with a special focus on pro-inflammation and cell-type specific models. Models are used in data analysis and experimental design, as well as the simulation of the single and combinatorial effect of proinflammation inhibitors. Additionally, I am exploring how various omics (genome wide and targeted) data can be used in model calibration and specification.
